# Boa

Boa is a fork of PyOxy from the [PyOxidizer](https://github.com/indygreg/PyOxidizer.git) project. It aims to produce a single-file, easily redistributable Python executable for Python projects. Unlike PyOxy, Boa simply aims to be a drop-in replacement for the `python` command, and as such is much simpler and much less configurable.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Automatic builds with GitHub actions
- [ ] Automatic releases
- [ ] Test on Windows + Mac + Linux
